# dynamo
Just JS stuff...

Dynamo provide important JS functions to allow quick development.

Features:  
 - Template caching (using ajax polling)  
 - Select2 initializer (with default value)  
 - DOM manipulation from HTML tag  
 - Data transfer  
 - Form data validation  
 - Dynamic insert/replace/delete after Ajax call
 - and more to come


 FYI, the code itself is a mess. I will be cleaning it and go deeper in the documentation if you wish.
